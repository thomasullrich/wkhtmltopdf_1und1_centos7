# wkhtmltopdf_1und1_centos7
No brainer installation of wkhtmltopdf on a 1und1 cloud server with odoo 10 installation with CentOS7

This is probably the fastest way to install wkhtmltopdf on a 1und1 cloud server with CentOS7 and Odoo 10 installed. 
Just copy wkhtmltopdf.sh to your root (via FTP) and execute it (via SSH or KVM Console).

In order to execute it, 
1. Type chmod +x wkhtmltopdf.sh and hit enter (gives you the rights to execute wkhtmltopdf.sh)
2. Type bash wkhtmltopdf.sh and hit enter.
3. If you find a google.pdf file on your server's root, wkhtmltopdf is properly installed.

Enjoy!
